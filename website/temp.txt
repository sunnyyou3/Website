What am i looking for.

Aiming for more money is an obvious thing and i think it's the main reason why people change jobs so often.
I'm also looking for a team of like minded people. People that you can share thoughts with and have an exchange of opinions,
instead of insisting that one method is better because another method looks or feels messier. People that can understand
quality and maintainability, how easy will it be to come back and make any changes in the future. People that can 
build on top of an already existing format instead of deviating away into their own. I believe ______ has the kinds
of people that I'm looking for and i would love to be a part of it.
